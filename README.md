## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to find more information about temperature trends before opening a surf shop. We want the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

This project consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. We will submit the following:
* Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
* Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
* Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

### Results

Snippet of Summary Statistics for June Temperatures

Snippet of Summary Statistics for December Temperatures

![December Temps](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25447945/130344269-ae834f54-3b6b-4b42-8357-5a436d733f6f.png)

From the above temperature summaries we can say the following:

* In the Month of June there are 1700 Observations whereas in December there are 1517 Observations, so we can say that some dates are missing temperature recordings for december. 
* Both the summary shows the maximum, minimum and average temperature for the Month and there is not a huge difference in those both months.
* After looking at the summary for both months we can say that the Weather in Oahu does not fluctuates much.

So it will be a great idea to open the surf and ice cream shop year round. 

### Summary 
While finding out the statistics summary for the two months, we can conclude that temperature patterns remain almost the same year round. It will be great to open the surf and ice cream shop year round. 
To get a better understanding of the weather in Oahu we would need to include more queries and here are teo which can be included
* We could do the precipitation statistics summary for the month of June and December. 
* We could also find the temerature statistics summary for more months to find out if temperature fluctuates in any other month. 

This information can gives us deep analysis of the Oahu Weather and can help us make a wise decision.
